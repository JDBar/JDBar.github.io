        <h2>Slow and Steady</h2>
        <p>
          My first attempt. Simply draws all the rectangles, even in unnecessary areas. Accurate until rectangles are below 0.1 pixels, then drawing is skipped.
        </p>
        <p>
          The quality is quite good, but cannot reach level 10 at a high resolution.

        <h2>Quick and Dirty</h2>
        <p>
          A faster second attempt that can easily reach level 10 at high resolutions. Instead of drawing each rectangle, it draws one at each level, and copies the top-left pixels and pastes them into the correct places.
        </p>
        <p>
          Less accurate than the slow solution, since subpixel accuracy is impossible.

        <h2>The Best</h2>
        <p>
          My third attempt which is the most accurate, and still really fast. This solution renders one level, then copies the entire pixel area to render the next level.
        </p>
        <p>
          This will render all squares at an infinitely small accuracy. Unfortunately, in reality, this leads to really horrible artifacts without a smoothing step. By default, this smoothing is enabled.
